### hello! 

software engineer with a focus on the product development experience. while my day to day involves ui engineering and all things ui adjacent, i thoroughly enjoy optimizing for web performance, developer + PM + designer workflow efficiency.

i've watched [the last dance](https://www.netflix.com/title/80203144) ~twice during shelter in place and~ ~~im probably going to watch it again.~~ ~im currently on my third watch. three times during quarantine.~  ~im currently on my fourth watch.~ 5. i don't even normally watch basketball or sports in general; it's just so good. im an enjoyer of making a pourover coffee, some fresh air, and maintaining way too many spotify playlists.

cheers,
char
